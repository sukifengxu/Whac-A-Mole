# Whac-A-Mole
The game Whac-a-mole. Recommend play with a mouse.

I wrote this little game for my programming partner after taking my first computer science course - a language course on Python and Java. The entire-semester-coding-experience with her was so much joy.

The Micky Mouse icons were carefully chosen. I also like the background music very much. Every piece of detail in this program is of great significance to me.
